## 📌 Project Overview

The **Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web Application** is a graduation project developed within the Department of Software Engineering at Fırat University. The goal is to assist users in receiving faster and more reliable disease predictions by entering their symptoms into a user-friendly web interface.

This application leverages multiple classification algorithms including **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Naive Bayes (NB)**, **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** and an advanced **BERT-based NLP model** to understand symptom expressions and predict diseases.

## 🧬 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Data processing & modeling)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (ML models: SVM, RF, KNN, NB, MLP)
- **Transformers - Hugging Face** (BERT NLP model)
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Frontend)
- **Google Colab + Google Drive** (Training & storage)

## 💡 Key Features

- 🔍 Predict possible diseases from user-entered symptoms
- 💻 Clean, responsive web interface for better user experience
- 🤖 NLP-based feature extraction using **BERT**
- 📈 Multiple ML classifiers compared and analyzed
- 🔐 Secure symptom processing without storing sensitive data
